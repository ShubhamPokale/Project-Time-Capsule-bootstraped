Time Capsule is the ability to send your life stories to anyone at a later date in the future. Simply upload the memory, enter the recipient's information, and pick a date in the future. That's it. Simple, Clean, Easy. These files are then safely stored and then sent back until the desired date; creating a nice nostalgic surprise
